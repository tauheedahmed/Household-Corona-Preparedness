# Household-Corona-Preparedness
Public safety officials in the US have long encouraged community members to maintain a household emergency plan that helps household members know what to do in case of fire. Such a plan has historically been extended to protect against other hazards like earthquakes, hurricanes and floods to which the community may be exposed. This list of potential hazards includes pandemics. The need for such a plan has of course never been more urgent for so many people around the world than today.
 
The plan on this webpage is in the form of a pdf document that you may open online or download. The document include steps to prevent the virus from entering your home. It also outlines steps you can take to minimize the damage in case a household member is infected.  

This plan does call for a few life-style changes. However these should, I hope you will agree after reading the document, be simple and easy to make for any household possessing soap and water. While this plan does not come with soap and water, it does come with something equally essential. That is the willingness of all members of the household to adapt to these changes immediately and in a sustainable manner over the weeks and months ahead.
