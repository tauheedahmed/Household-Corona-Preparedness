# Purpose of this webpage: Household-Corona-Preparedness
Public safety officials in the US have long encouraged community members to maintain a household emergency plan that helps household members know what to do in case of fire. Such a plan has historically been extended to protect against other hazards like earthquakes, hurricanes and floods to which the community may be exposed. This list of potential hazards includes pandemics. The need for such a plan has of course never been more urgent for so many people around the world than today.
 
The plan on this webpage is in the form of a pdf document that you may open online or download. This document includes measures designed to prevent the virus from invading your home. It also outlines some basic measures to minimize damage in case the virus does manage to break through.   

These measures call for a few life-style changes. Physically these changes are simple and easy to make for any household possessing soap and water. In order to ensure ultimate success of these measures, however, you will need one more ingredient. That is the willingness of all members of the household to adapt to these changes as soon as possible; and to do so in a way that is sustainable over the weeks and months ahead.  While this plan does not come with soap and water, it does include some tips to this end as well.
